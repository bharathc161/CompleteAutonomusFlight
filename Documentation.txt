
Still working on it:
Aim: is to make drone fly on its own from required source to the 	destination.
Possible by?:



Let's breakdown it in few specific field to work with

1.Using dji SDK
(see below link for details)
Using android Studio (interfacing it with google maps , we can get completely autonomous flight)

2. I am trying implementing few recent related papers, see below links for details

And the brief idea of tools/platform will be working on DJI APIs, Node-RED(generally used to send commands to the drone), Watson IBM Studio, IBM cloud, opencv, keras, tensorflow ,etc.
